Step 1: Begin with the following code:
void setup() {
  size(700, 500);
  
}

void draw() {
  background(100, 10, 100); //or choose a color

}

Step 2: Draw three equally sized rectangles across the screen
rect(x,y, width, height)
line them up evenly (same Y coordinates)
spread them out so they are equally spaced

Step 3: Change the stroke, strokeWeight and fill colours for each rectangle


Step 4: Label the rectangles with text to explain one of its characteristics.
text(“Stroke size: 3”, x, y) or text(“Fill colour: aquamarine”, x, y)
Text color can be changed with the FILL line


Step 5: Draw a large circle, centred on the screen. Change the stroke, strokeWeight and fill colours as you wish.
ellipse(x,y, width, height)

Step 6: Draw two eyes.  Change the stroke, strokeWeight and fill colours as you wish.

Step 7: Draw the mouth.  Change the stroke, strokeWeight and fill colours as you wish.
line(x1,y1, x2,y2);     These are the starting and ending coordinates of the line.
Lines are affected by the STROKE codes.
